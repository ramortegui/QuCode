# Day 18: Variational Quantum Algorithms

Date: September 18, 2025

## Introduction to Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs)

- Are Hybrid classical-quantum Algorithms
- Use classical algorithms to optimize parametrized quantum circuits

Advantages:
- A bridge between today's quantum computers and future fault-tolerant ones.
- leverages quantum mechanical principles.
- Circuits are small enough to run on today's computers.
- Adapted to a wide part of problems.

Challenges:
- Limited by the noise present in current quantum computers
- May find suboptimal solutions
- Limited problem sizes because of qubit count, error rates and coherence times
