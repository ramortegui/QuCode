# Day 9: Quantum Gates & Circuits

**Date:** September 9th  

## Pauli gates

Pauli X gate |0> -> |1>

X = [[0 1]
     [1 0]]

Z = [[1 0]
     [0 -1]]

Y = [[0 -i]
     [i 0]]

## Hadamard

H = 1/sqrt(2)[
    [1 1]
    [1 -1]
    ]

h(|0>) -> 1/sqrt(2) (|0> + |1>)
h(|1>) -> 1/sqrt(2) (|0> - |1>)


## Phase
Z

## CNOT
Controlt not.

## Unitary transformations

Need to comply with:
1. unitary
4. Harmitian (not always R gate ;)
3. Opeartion with the transpose congujate should give the identity matrix.
