# Day 7: Quantum Mechanics Basics

**Date:** September 7th  

## The Schrödinger Equation

The Schrödinger equation is the fundamental differential equation of quantum mechanics that describes how quantum states (wave functions) evolve over time. The square of the normalized wave function gives the probability density of finding a particle in a given region.


1. tile evolution is reversible
2. probabiliity is conserved through time

## Quantum Measurement

- Probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics

The measurement is going to give a probability of a particle to be in a position. 



## Postulates of Quantum Mechanics

III The result of a measurement of a physical quantity is one of the eigenvalues of the associated observable.

IV The measurement of A in a system in normalized state |>spi> gives eigen value lambdan with a probability.
