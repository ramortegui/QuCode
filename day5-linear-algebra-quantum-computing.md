# Day 5: Linear Algebra for Quantum Computing

**Date:** September 5th  

- Linear algebra provides the mathematical foundation for quantum computing
- These concepts are essential for understanding quantum gates and operations
- Mastery of these topics enables deeper understanding of quantum algorithms


## Tensor Products

Properties:
1. Needs to be linear with respect to scalar multiplication
2. Distributive with respect to vector addition

## Inner/Outer Products

Inner product is similar to dot product with some rules around multiplication, and length.

Outer product
- Describe measurements 

## Unitary Operators
Any operator that satisfies Hermitian conjugate equals its inverse.
Generalizes rotations. Keeps the length and corresponding angle.

The eigenvalues of a unitary operator must have magnitude one.

Unitary operators conserve probability.

## Unitary Matrices (unitary transformations)

U preserves inner product

## Schr√∂dinger Equation

- Wavelength is inversely proportional to its mass
- Microscopic objects have negligible weights.
- Electrons can be viewed as particles and waves.

## Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics

- Copenhagen interpretation
- many-worlds interpretation
- quantum decoherence
- Bohmian mechanics
