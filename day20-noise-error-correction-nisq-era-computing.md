# Day 20: Noise, Error Correction & NISQ Era Computing

*Date: September 20, 2025*


## Challenges building Quantum Computers

### Building qubits

- Photons:  Using a beam splitter to create a superposition state and use properties like polarization
- Ions and atoms: Energy levels, lasers could be use to control and manipulate the states.
- Superconductors: Popular approach (google and IBM), build an artificial atoms.


A qubit in a superposition and entanglement is fragile and could be contain errors and noise, and decohere.

This could be addressed by Quantum Error Correction, by starting with noisy physical qubits, and encode the information into logical qubits.

To measure the Qubits, you need to decode.


## Quantum Errors

How to mitigate:
- Repetition
- To read if errors have happened, we don't measure the qubit itself, but looking some other properties, like if qubits are similar without looking at the encoding information.
