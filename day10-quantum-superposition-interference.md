# Day 10: Quantum Superposition & Interference

**Date:** September 10th  

## Quantum parallelism

Is a fundamental property of any quantum algorithm based on the quantum superposition principle, and only uses one unitary logical operation.

First register is called data register
The second register is called value register

The output data constains data for the results of aplying the functions to the funcions over the inputs in superposition.

## Interference in quantum states
