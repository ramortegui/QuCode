# Day 12: Quantum Measurement & No-Cloning Theorem

**Date:** September 13th  

Quantum  Mechanics Interpretation:

Definitions:

- Wave function: 



Coppenhagen interpretation:
- Wave function describes a probability of finding a system in a given states.  When there is a measurements, the wave function collapses.


Hidden variables:
- Changes the interpretation of quantum mechanics from probabilistic to deterministic.  This was discharged by Bell tests.

Many Worlds interpretation
- There is an infinite number of universes, and there is an option valid for each one of the universes.

Continous Spontaneus Localisation
- The interaction localizes the quantum state.

## Projective measurement
After measurement or a multiple qubit system, the new states should be normalized.  It means that it should have the sum of the squared root of the amplituds equal to one.

- Eigen Value:
It's a magic state that states the same after applying an operator.


- Uncertainty principle
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says: we cannot know exactly both the position (state) and the momentum (speed and direction) of a quantum particle at the same time.
