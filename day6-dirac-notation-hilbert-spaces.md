# Day 6: Dirac Notation & Hilbert Spaces

**Date:** September 6th  
## Dirac Notation

Dirac notation, also known as bra-ket notation, is a standard mathematical notation used in quantum mechanics to describe quantum states. In this notation, a quantum state is represented as a "ket", and its dual (complex conjugate transpose) is represented as a "bra".

## Hilbert Spaces

Is the mathecatical space where the quantum states live.
