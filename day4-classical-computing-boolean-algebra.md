# Day 4: Introduction to Classical Computing & Boolean Algebra

## Classical Computing Fundamentals

### What is Classical Computing?
Classical computing is based on the principles of classical physics and uses binary digits (bits) to represent and process information. Each bit can exist in one of two states: 0 or 1. There exist gates like NOT, AND.

## Qubits
Can be 0 or 1, and it can be converted using gates like X (NOT) that will flip the values.

The bloch sphere help us to represent the qubits and its transformations on X, Y, and Z gates.

## Measurements
When measuring a qubit, it collapses the states of a qubit. "Collapsing a superposition". It's destructive.

The Bloch sphere helps us to represent the position of a qubit. The gates are operations that are represented in vector movements.

## Classical Computer Gates
AND / OR / NOR / NAND / XOR / etc.

## Transform a Classical Function to Quantum Function
Transform classical circuits to be reversible
