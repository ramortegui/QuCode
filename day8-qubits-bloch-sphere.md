# Day 8: Qubits & Bloch Sphere Representation + Hands On Submission- Build simple circuits: X, H, Z, CNOT, Bell state

**Date:** September 8th  


## Classical bits
- State 1 or 0
- Physical representation + or - (on/off)
- Can be manipulated with the control gates

## Quantum bits
- Represent Quantum mechanical states
- |1> |0> or both
- Can be manipulated with quantum gates


Pauli X gate (not)


## Superposition
|psi> = a|0> +b|1>

a,b E C

Representation: Matrix

Quantum Logic gates:
- Matrix 2 x 2

Pauli X gate
Hadamard gate

the matrices needs to be Hermitian, Unitary, Eagen values sshould be real. 

Ensures conservation of probability


## Single-qubit states


## Quantum state visualization
