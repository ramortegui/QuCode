# Day 1: Complex Numbers & Linear Algebra Basics

**Date:** September 1st  

## Vectors

### In Physics
Arrows pointing in space, and are defined by their length and direction.

### In Math
Anything where there's a sensible notion of adding two vectors or multiplying by a scalar.

### In Computing Science
List of ordered items.

### Geometric Interpretation
An arrow inside a coordinate system that starts at the origin, it can be composed of multiple dimensions. It defines how far each coordinate needs to be moved from the initial position.

### Operations
- **Vector addition**: Combining two vectors
- **Scalar multiplication**: Scaling a vector by a number

## Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

### Eigenvectors
Vectors that do not change direction when a linear transformation is applied.

### Eigenvalues
The scalar factors by which eigenvectors are stretched or compressed during a transformation.

## Key Takeaways
- Vectors are fundamental mathematical objects with different interpretations across fields
- Eigenvectors maintain their direction under linear transformations
- Eigenvalues represent the scaling factor of eigenvectors
