# Day 3: Physics — Quantum vs. Classical Mechanics  

**Date:** September 3rd  

## Entanglement  
One particle’s state depends on the state of another particle. It’s a mysterious connection.  

## Superposition  
An object can exist in multiple states until it is measured.  

## Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle  
It is impossible to simultaneously and precisely measure a particle’s position, speed, and direction.  

## Tunneling  
Particles can pass through barriers that would be insurmountable in classical physics.  

## Quantum Computing  
Computers can use qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously.  

## Double-Slit Experiment  
An interference pattern arises when particles pass through a double slit. They can act as both waves and particles.  

## Wave-Particle Duality  
Waves can behave like particles, and particles can behave like waves
