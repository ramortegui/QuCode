# Day 11: Bell States, EPR Paradox, and Non-locality

## Bell inequality

Bell's inequality is a mathematical test that distinguishes between classical physics (where particles have predetermined properties) and quantum mechanics (where properties are created by measurement), showing that quantum entanglement produces correlations that are impossible in any classical theory.

The EPR paradox, suggested by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, points out how quantum mechanics predicts that entangled particles can instantly influence each other, no matter how far apart they are. This seems to go against the common-sense idea that things can only affect each other if they are close by. Hidden variables, the states were already defined since the begining.


Particles separated a far distance, and there is no way to communicate faster than speed of light.

Two particles entangled, no mater how far away are, when we measure one, the other one will have the oposite measurement.
